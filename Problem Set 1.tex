\section{Problem 1}
Translate the following sentences from English to predicate logic. The domain that you are working over is $X$, the set of people. You may use the functions $S(x)$, meaning that``$x$ has been a student of 6.042,” $A(x)$, meaning that ``$x$ has gotten an ‘A’ in 6.042,” $T(x)$, meaning that ``$x$ is a TA of 6.042,” and $E(x,y)$, meaning that ``$x$ and $y$ are the same person.”

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item There are people who have taken 6.042 and have gotten A’s in 6.042

$$\exists x \in X. \ S(x). \ A(x).$$

\item All people who are 6.042 TA’s and have taken 6.042 got A’s in 6.042

$$\forall x \in X. \ T(x). \ S(x). \ A(x).$$

\item There are no people who are 6.042 TA’s who did not get A’s in 6.042

$$\exists x \in X. \ T(x). \ \neg A(x)$$

\item There are at least three people who are TA’s in 6.042 and have not taken 6.042

$$\exists x_1,x_2,x_3 \in X. \ T(x_1). \ T(x_2). \ T(x_3). \ \neg E(x_1,x_2,x_3). \ \neg S(x).  $$
\end{enumerate}
